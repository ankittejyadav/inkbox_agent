## 🌟 Architectural Vision & System Design

The `inkbox_agent` system is architected as a decoupled client-server application, emphasizing a clear separation of concerns between the interactive agent interface and its underlying data and business logic services. The core design principle revolves around an API-first approach, where the Svelte-powered frontend agent communicates exclusively through well-defined RESTful and WebSocket APIs. This modularity facilitates independent development, deployment, and scaling of both frontend and backend components.

Data flows from various upstream services into a centralized Node.js/TypeScript backend, which acts as an aggregation and processing layer. The backend exposes a secure API gateway to the Svelte agent, providing both synchronous (REST) and asynchronous (WebSocket) communication channels. This hybrid approach ensures that critical configuration and command-and-control operations are handled via robust HTTP requests, while real-time operational metrics and event notifications are pushed efficiently to the agent via WebSockets, enabling a highly responsive user experience.
